# Hello, I'm Ramesh :wave:

I'm a Ph.D. student, tinkerer, and self-proclaimed poetü§û. I grew up riding bicycles in a small town in Nepal. I like to go hiking in the mountains and walk on beaches. 

- ‚öíÔ∏è My Ph.D. research is about learning with limited labels using machine learning algorithms. My research applications focus on embedded sensor systems in the healthcare domain. We address problems such as preventing alcohol relapse, stress detection, and classification and learning complex human behavior in real-life settings.
