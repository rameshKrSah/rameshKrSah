# Hello, I'm Ramesh :wave:

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student, tinkerer, and self-proclaimed poet🤞. I grew up riding bicycles in a small town in Nepal. I like to go hiking in the mountains and walk on beaches. 

- ⚒️ My Ph.D. research is on learning with limited labels using machine learning algorithms. I am applying my research to address problems in healthcare such as preventing alcohol relapse, stress detection, human activity recognition, and learning complex human behavior in real-life settings. I use embedded sensor systems to collect time-series data related to various bio-markers and train state-of-the-art machine learning models while addressing issues such as class imbalance, noisy labels, and small datasets.
