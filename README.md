# Hello, I'm Ramesh :wave:

I'm a Ph.D. student, tinkerer, and self-proclaimed poetü§û. I grew up riding bicycles in a small town in Nepal. I like to go hiking in the mountains and walk on beaches. 

- ‚öíÔ∏è My Ph.D. research is on learning with limited labels using machine learning algorithms. I am applying my research to address problems in health care such as preventing alcohol relapse, stress detection, and learning complex human behavior in real-life settings. I use wearable sensor systems to collect multi-modal physiological sensor data and other markers such as surveys, images, and interviews.
